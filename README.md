# personal-website

I don't think it's a good idea, But I wanna do it.

## Motivation

When I write code for my personal websites, I think it's so repetitive when I just use HTML、CSS、Javascript or ever React.

So, I'll choose a new one to write it and raise my passion(Actually, It's so bad feel when I choose blaze-html and clay, this is nothing you should use it in production and I just wanna fun). 

What about blaze-html and clay? It's just a libiray in hackage and for Haskeller to write some html and css contents.
